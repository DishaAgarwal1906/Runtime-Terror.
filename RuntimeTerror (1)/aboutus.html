    <h2>Prediction of Admission and Jobs in Engineering and Technology/Management/Pharmacy with Respect to Demographic Locations</h2>
    <p>
        India as we know is a densely populated country and Every year more than 6 crores of Indians graduates from diverse backgrounds and with diversity in education. Almost similar number of students enter into colleges for taking various education to help them in seeking jobs. Many sectors have experienced tremendous growth in employment and thus masses opt for those sectors whereas in many sectors there
         is huge unemployment either due to low jobs availability or demand of skilled workers is required. Thinking of the each and every branch and when comparing it with the current employment in India and abroad, we will definitely find some points that will help in predicting the admissions and jobs scenarios in the fields of engineering and technology, management and pharmacy. Due to the changing technology 
         and its requirement for getting employed in India and abroad, there has to improvements suggested by experts for predicting the Prediction of Admission & Jobs in Engineering & Technology with respect to demographic locations. This is not a one time process and needs to be done frequently as trends in the industry keep changing. Addressing this problem will introduce the required changes that would bring the
          current youth and upcoming generations in parallel with the students of other countries in terms of knowledge and skills in that domain. There is a need to forecast the current trend in the admissions and job sectors so as to blend the courses and syllabus accordingly to keep the youth employed and skilled with rapidly changing world. Here we will achieve it by using Machine Learning algorithm.

<h4> INTRODUCTION </h4>
<p>
India, as we all know, is a highly populated nation, and every year, more than 6 crore Indians graduate from a variety of educational backgrounds and socioeconomic backgrounds. A nearly equal percentage of students enroll in institutions to pursue various degrees that will aid in their career search. In comparison to ten years ago, the demands of the work market have changed significantly with the advancement 
of technology. While there is significant unemployment in many industries due to either a lack of jobs or a need for qualified workers, several sectors have seen remarkable development in employment and as a result, many people choose to work in those sectors. When considering each and every branch and contrasting it with the employment trends both in India and abroad, we will undoubtedly discover some factors
 that will assist in predicting admissions and employment scenarios in the fields of management, pharmacy, and engineering and technology.
</p>
<h4> PROBLEM STATEMENT </h4>
<p>
Improvements have been suggested by experts for predicting the Prediction of Admission & Jobs in Engineering  &  Technology,  Management,  and  Pharmacy with respect to demographic locations due to the changing technology and its requirement for employment in India and abroad. Due to the constant shift in industry trends, this is not a one-time process that needs to be completed frequently. If this problem
 is solved, the necessary changes will be made, putting the young people of today and the generations to come up with the same knowledge and skills as students in other countries. However, despite AICTE's approval of the proposed courses, graduates of such institutions, engineering divisions, management departments, schools,  and  others  continue  to be unemployed. There is currently no method for 
 estimating or forecasting the short- and long-term employment potential of any Engineering, Management, Pharmacy, or other course by combining data from various sources and developing a computer program or application. In order to keep young people employed and skilled in a world that is rapidly changing, it is necessary to forecast the current trend in the admissions and employment sectors in order to
  blend the courses and syllabus accordingly.

Educational institutions have always been crucial to a person's personal growth and development in society. There are currently a number of college prediction apps and websites, but using them is somewhat tedious due to the lack of clear information about colleges and the time required to find the best worthy school.
</p>
<h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
<p>
The AICTE grants approval for the launch of new courses and the establishment of new technical institutions in the fields of management, architecture, engineering, and technology, among others. The AICTE's (Approval Process Handbook) minimum standards for infrastructure are currently the primary criterion for granting approval for such courses. However, despite AICTE's approval of the proposed courses,
 graduates of such institutions, engineering divisions, management departments, pharmacy schools, and others continue to be unemployed. Correlating data from various sources and developing a computer program or application using neural networks OR any other programming tools is currently the only method available to estimate or forecast employment potential for any branch(s) or course(s) in engineering,
  management, pharmacy, etc. on a short-term and long-term basis. The creation of software for estimating and forecasting graduate and postgraduate employment potential in various fields and courses on a short-term and long- term basis by combining data from various sources could be useful for approving infrastructure and other facilities. Current time simulated intelligence and figuring frameworks can be
   utilized to help simultaneously and any huge advancement in this field is exceptionally valued which thinks about different factors and gauges the affirmations and occupations area situations. In order to keep young people employed and skilled in a world that is rapidly changing, it is necessary to forecast the current trend in the admissions and employment sectors in order to blend the courses and 
   syllabus accordingly. We will use a machine learning algorithm to accomplish this here.
